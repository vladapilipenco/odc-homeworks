    <p>
      The Greeks have been eating octopus since ancient times, and it's still on
      the menu of the country's many taverns. On the islands, where the catch is
      often fresh, octopus is grilled over charcoal, seasoned with fresh lemon.
      If you've never tried it before, you should know that octopus can be
      notoriously tough and rubbery. The first question most people ask is how
      to get the octopus truly tender. If you tried to grill the octopus from
      raw stage, you'd end up with the most awfully chewy tentacles, so the meat
      needs a little help before it hits the grill. The TRULY old school Greek
      fisherman tenderizing method is to bash the octopus against some seaside
      rocks, but I'm going to assume you don't have that kind of rock access,
      and lord knows there are cleaner ways to go about it. Boiling is the most
      common way to soften the meat, and that's the step I've found most
      successful.
