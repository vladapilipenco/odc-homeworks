            <h3>Who Is Quentin Tarantino?</h3>
            <p>
              Born in Tennessee in 1963, Quentin Tarantino moved to California
              at age 4. His love of movies led to a job in a video store, during
              which time he wrote the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born
              Killers. Tarantino's directorial debut came with 1992's Reservoir
              Dogs, but he received widespread critical and commercial acclaim
              with Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he won an Academy Award for
              best screenplay. Subsequent features included Jackie Brown (1997),
              Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) and Grindhouse (2007).
              Tarantino earned several award nominations for Inglourious
              Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012), the latter garnering
              him a second Oscar win for best screenplay, and he went on to
              write and direct The Hateful Eight (2015) and Once Upon a Time...
              in Hollywood (2019).
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
              Quentin Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville,
              Tennessee. He is the only child of Connie McHugh, who is part
              Cherokee and part Irish, and actor Tony Tarantino, who left the
              family before Quentin was born. Moving to California at the age of
              4, Tarantino developed his love for movies at an early age. One of
              his earliest memories is of his grandmother taking him to see a
              John Wayne movie. Tarantino also loved storytelling, but he showed
              his creativity in unusual ways. "He wrote me sad Mother's Day
              stories. He'd always kill me and tell me how bad he felt about
              it," Connie once told Entertainment Weekly. "It was enough to
              bring a tear to a mother's eye." Tarantino loathed school,
              choosing to spend his time watching movies or reading comics
              rather than studying. The only subject that appealed to him was
              history. "History was cool and I did well there, because it was
              kind of like the movies," he told Entertainment Weekly. After
              dropping out of high school, Tarantino worked as an usher at an
              adult film theater for a time. He also took acting classes.
              Tarantino eventually landed a job at Video Archives in Manhattan
              Beach, California. There he worked with Roger Avary, who shared
              his passion for film. The two even worked on some script ideas
              together.

            With Pulp Fiction (1994), Tarantino created an unpredictable thrill
            ride filled with violence and pop culture references. In one story
            in the film, John Travolta played Vincent Vega, a hit man assigned
            to look after his boss's girlfriend (Uma Thurman)—a role that helped
            resuscitate his then-flagging career. Another part examined Vega's
            partnership with fellow hit man Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel L.
            Jackson). And yet another storyline involved Bruce Willis as a
            boxer. Tarantino managed to successfully interweave all these
            different stories to make a fascinating film. "His mind works like
            the Tasmanian Devil on a bullet train. It's so fast that very few
            people can keep up with his references," actor Eric Stoltz, who
            played a drug dealer in the film, explained to Los Angeles magazine.
            Pulp Fiction was both a commercial and critical success. In the
            United States, it earned over $108 million at the box office,
            becoming the first independent film to do so. Pulp Fiction won the
            prestigious Palme d'Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994 and
            received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and
            Best Director. For his work on the film, Tarantino took home the
            award for Best Original Screenplay, an honor he had to share with
            former collaborator Roger Avary. The two had a falling out over the
            writing credits for the film.
