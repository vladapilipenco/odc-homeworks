          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <h3>Who Is Quentin Tarantino?</h3>
          <p>
            Born in Tennessee in 1963, Quentin Tarantino moved to California at
            age 4. His love of movies led to a job in a video store, during
            which time he wrote the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born
            Killers. Tarantino's directorial debut came with 1992's Reservoir
            Dogs, but he received widespread critical and commercial acclaim
            with Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he won an Academy Award for best
            screenplay. Subsequent features included Jackie Brown (1997), Kill
            Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) and Grindhouse (2007).
            Tarantino earned several award nominations for Inglourious Basterds
            (2009) and Django Unchained (2012), the latter garnering him a
            second Oscar win for best screenplay, and he went on to write and
            direct The Hateful Eight (2015) and Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood
            (2019).

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Quentin Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville,
            Tennessee. He is the only child of Connie McHugh, who is part
            Cherokee and part Irish, and actor Tony Tarantino, who left the
            family before Quentin was born. Moving to California at the age of
            4, Tarantino developed his love for movies at an early age. One of
            his earliest memories is of his grandmother taking him to see a John
            Wayne movie. Tarantino also loved storytelling, but he showed his
            creativity in unusual ways. "He wrote me sad Mother's Day stories.
            He'd always kill me and tell me how bad he felt about it," Connie
            once told Entertainment Weekly. "It was enough to bring a tear to a
            mother's eye." Tarantino loathed school, choosing to spend his time
            watching movies or reading comics rather than studying. The only
            subject that appealed to him was history. "History was cool and I
            did well there, because it was kind of like the movies," he told
            Entertainment Weekly. After dropping out of high school, Tarantino
            worked as an usher at an adult film theater for a time. He also took
            acting classes. Tarantino eventually landed a job at Video Archives
            in Manhattan Beach, California. There he worked with Roger Avary,
            who shared his passion for film. The two even worked on some script
            ideas together.
